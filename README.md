# nBRC

A Pytorch implementation of the **neuromodulated bistable recurrent cell** (nBRC) from 
**[A bio-inspired bistable recurrent cell allows for long-lasting memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05252)**. 

Also features a small experimental setup for the Denoising benchmarks described in the paper. 

See original tensorflow implementation [here](https://github.com/nvecoven/BRC/tree/5563e1e97a83407bf9746dd8138ecd0f9b0159df).
