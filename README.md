# nBRC

A Pytorch implementation of the **neuromodulated bistable recurrent cell** (nBRC) from 
**[A bio-inspired bistable recurrent cell allows for long-lasting memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05252)**. 

Also features a small experimental setup for the Denoising benchmarks described in the paper. Also available as **[Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1meiWR1hOu7ksEV2reaT_texwNc4JWaJv?usp=sharing)** where an nBRC model and an LSTM model are trained for the Denoising benchmark from the paper.

See original tensorflow implementation [here](https://github.com/nvecoven/BRC/).
